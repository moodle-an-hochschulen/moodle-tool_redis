 * Admin tool "Redis management" - Redis Stats Flush DB stub.
 *
 * The Valkey Stats code which we have placed into lib/valkey-stats/valkey-stats.php.inc
 * is calling a file called flushdb.php to flush the Redis DB.
 * With this file, we provide a stub at the location where the Valkey Stats code expect it to be and include the original file.
